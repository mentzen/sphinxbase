CMU Sphinx common libraries for [this](https://github.com/mentzen/Sphinxbase-CocoaPod) CocoaPod
===============================================================================

This package contains the basic libraries shared by the CMU Sphinx trainer and
all the Sphinx decoders (Sphinx-II, Sphinx-III, and PocketSphinx), as well as
some common utilities for manipulating acoustic feature and audio files.

**Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.**

Linux/Unix installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sphinxbase is used by other modules.  The convention requires the
physical layout of the code looks like this:

    .
    ├── package/
    └── sphinxbase/

XCode Installation (for iPhone CocoaPod)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sphinxbase uses the standard unix autogen system, you can build sphinxbase with
automake. You just need to pass correct configure arguments, set compiler path,
set sysroot and other options. After you build the code you need to import
dylib file into your project and you also need to configure includes for your
project to find sphinxbase headers.

You also will have to create a recorder to capture audio with CoreAudio and
feed it into the recognizer.

# CMUSphinx iOS build script

This is a shell script to build CMUSphinx libraries for iOS apps.

Tested with Xcode 6

## Usage

You need to build both sphinxbase and pocketsphinx. First clone both
from github, then run autogen.sh inside both in order to create
configure. You need to have autotools installed for that. Then copy
build script in sphinxbase folder and in pocketsphinx folder. Change
current folder to sphinxbase and run build script from this folder. Then
go to pocketsphinx and run build there.

Script takes a list of architectures to build as an argument.

To build everything:

        ./build_iphone.sh

To build arm64 libraries:

        ./build_iphone.sh arm64

To build fat libraries for armv7 and x86_64 (64-bit simulator):

        ./build_iphone.sh armv7 x86_64
